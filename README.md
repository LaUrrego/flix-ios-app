### Notes
TableView was a complex topic to implement, but highly valuable once I saw how widespread it's applications were. It took several tries to understand auto layout and making it work with various screens, but the end result gave me perspective on how to hold myself accountable to making apps that were accessible by practically any iOS device, and not just the latest model. 

I was able to get the app to work on my phyical phone after connecting it with Xcode, but when I updated to iOS 16, compatibility was no longer supported so that I could add it as part of my walkthrough GIF. I will update it once Xcode catches up with support for iOS 16.
